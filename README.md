### Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm shantaram, a self-taught hobbyist software engineer and open-source enthusiast from India.

I have experience in the following:
* front-end JavaScript, with extensive experience working with the DOM APIs
* HTML5 and CSS
* Python (especially the standard library)
* Bash scripting (Along with extensive experience using desktop Linux)
* Node.js
* C programming
* Java programming

I'm also currently learning Svelte, TypeScript, and Rust.

Stuff I've made that I'm particularly proud of:
* [My website](https://shantaram.xyz) - Always representative of my latest HTML5 and CSS skills. Deliberately built with minimal JavaScript, functions properly even without it. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/shantaram3013/newsite)\]

* [leo](https://pypi.org/project/leo-gmi/) - A lightweight browser for the [Gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) \[[GitHub](https://github.com/shantaram3013/leo)\]
* [the hugs app](https://shantaram.xyz/hugs) - A small JS webapp to send virtual hugs to your friends. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/shantaram3013/hugs)\]
* [googlesheets-proxy](https://github.com/shantaram3013/googlesheets-proxy) A simple node.js Google Sheet proxy, that downloads a sheet and passes it on with the correct CORS headers set
* [XF86-Button-Utils](https://github.com/shantaram3013/XF86-Button-Utils) A set of utility scripts for X11 desktops.

Some useful libraries/software I wrote:
