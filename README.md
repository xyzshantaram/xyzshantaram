### Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm shantaram, a self-taught hobbyist software engineer and open-source enthusiast from India.

I have experience in the following:
* front-end JavaScript, with extensive experience working with the DOM APIs
* TypeScript in both front-end and back-end contexts, experience working with Deno
* Web programming in Rust
* HTML5 and CSS
* Bash scripting (Along with extensive experience using desktop Linux)
* Python
* Node.js
* C programming

Stuff I've made that I'm particularly proud of:
* [My website](https://shantaram.xyz) - Always representative of my latest HTML5 and CSS skills. Deliberately built with minimal JavaScript, functions properly even without it. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/xyzshantaram/newsite)\]
* [rite-cloud](https://riteapp.co.in) - Cloud backup solution for the [rite text editor](https://github.com/xyzshantaram/rite). Written in Rust. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/xyzshantaram/rite-cloud)\]

* [the hugs app](https://shantaram.xyz/hugs) - A small JS webapp to send virtual hugs to your friends. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/xyzshantaram/hugs)\]

Some useful libraries/software I wrote:
